**Magnesium** is the container that runs my Discord bot, which is fully documented in a dedicated repository due to its size and complexity.

This bot integrates with multiple services in my homelab, including:
- **Plex** (via Radarr/Sonarr APIs)
- **SQL database** for game tracking and user interaction
- **Web scraping** for real-time data
- **Authorization and approval systems** for media management

Given the standalone nature and development effort behind this bot, it is kept in its own repository to allow for clearer issue tracking, updates, and version control.
